TODO:

- automate Sublime Text preferences (plists)

- automatically copy wallpapers to ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/.
    - apply to System Preferences / Desktop & Screen Saver
        - Change picture: Every 30 minutes
        - Random order
    - maybe download separately instead of bundling with dotfiles
        - wget ZIP from somewhere, then extract to ~/Pictures
        - separate GitHub repo?

- get rid of all the cruft (namely stuff leftover from winocm fork)

- git clone dotfiles to ~/Projects
    - bootstrap.sh accomplishes half of this
    - can't use git before running dotfiles, can't get dotfiles (with .git) before installing git
    - setup post-install script to be run before reboot (at least after installing Xcode CLT) that connects local repo to remote

- upgrade.sh is symlinked... why not symlink it ALL? (./dotfiles/*, etc)

- rework menu bar items to account for Big Sur

- remove files in ./temporary (fix them accordingly)
