TODO:
- 10.5 and below: tigerbrew; 10.7/10.8: macports; 10.10 and above: homebrew
- automate various program installations
    - without brew (cask) on <10.10 (how?)
    - check how tigerbrew can install things (does it support brew cask?)
    - 10.7: Firefox Legacy, Sublime Text, LibreOffice (probably the same on 10.8, except LibreOffice needs to be updated)
- automate macports programs? + brew (cask) programs on applicable platforms
- automatically create ~/Projects dir + create link on sidebar ("Favorites")
- specify what is and is not shown in Finder
    - i.e. sidebar + desktop
    - maybe dock?
- automate Sublime Text preferences
-  check for Xcode + Command Line Tools before installing
-  implement Mountain Lion installation script (probably same as Lion, excluding LibreOffice)
    - why 10.8 instead of 10.7? -> 10.8 is still supported by LibreOffice (it's 64-bit... sort of)
- add Liony McLionface for Lion installer; uninstall when finished
    - build LM -> use "~/lm/curl", etc. to install macports and co. -> "rm -rf ~/lm"
    - check if LM can work on Mountain Lion
    - ... OR just use MacPorts to install updated OpenSSL / curl / whatever, bypassing LM entirely (can this be done headlessly?)
- enable verbose boot for ultimate hacker points
    - sudo nvram boot-args="-v"
        - needs to be [sudo nvram boot-args="-v -no_compat_check"] for patched devices (e.g. MacBook6,1 on Catalina)
- make scrolling not bad (disable flipflop wheel)
- allow double tap on touchpad --> drag (in Accessibility)
- disable "dim backlight slightly when running on battery power"
- detect if machine is either a laptop or a desktop?
- "sudo spctl --master-disable" to disable Gatekeeper (be rid of "app cannot be opened b/c it's from an unknown developer")
- status bar
    - show full date
    - show time with seconds
    - show login switcher (short name)

-----

disable guest user on login screen (theoretically):
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.AppleFileServer guestAccess -bool NO
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.smb.server AllowGuestAccess -bool NO
(probably not)
(not that it matters; this isn't a problem anymore)

disable dock resizing:
    defaults write com.apple.Dock size-immutable -bool yes; killall Dock

+ lots of stuff from winocm's dotfiles (disable autocorrect, .DS_Store go away, etc.)
